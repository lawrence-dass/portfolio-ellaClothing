# Ella Clothing

Ella Clothing is a single-page e-commerce application built as a personal portfolio project. The primary focus of this project was to deepen my experience with Redux Saga for advanced state management, integrate Firebase for serverless backend functionality (authentication, database, and hosting), and utilize Styled Components for modern, maintainable styling. The project also demonstrates a fully responsive, mobile-first design and incorporates best practices in accessibility, performance, and SEO.

The site scores 90% on Performance and 100% in all other aspects in Lighthouse (Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO), loading in less than 3 seconds on average.
